# github-responder

![Build](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/github-responder/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![hairyhenderson/github-responder on DockerHub][dockerhub-image]][dockerhub-url]

A library & CLI tool that automatically sets up GitHub WebHooks and listens for events, with automatic TLS provided by [certmagic][].

For example, if you want to run a command every time someone stars your repo (the `watch` event):

```console
$ github-responder --repo my/repo --domain myhost.example.com -e watch ./ring-the-bell.sh
...
```

This will do a bunch of things:
1. Register a new Webhook at the named repo (`--repo`)
2. Start a web server to serve webhook events
3. Run the command `ring-the-bell.sh` every time a `watch` event is received

A few more details:
- github-responder is reasonably secure:
  - the webhook server is automatically protected by TLS, configured with a free automatically-renewing certificate from [Let's Encrypt][]
  - the webhook listens at a randomly-generated URL - all other traffic is rejected
  - incoming events must be signed by a randomly-generated secret key - every event is verified
- the command is provided with all event details:
  - the event type is provided as the first flag on the command line
  - the unique delivery ID is provided as the second flag on the command line (this can be used to de-duplicate events, which may be re-delivered in some cases)
  - the event payload is sent to the command as standard input (in JSON format)
- logs are output as structured JSON, or in a slightly easier-to-read format when run in an interactive terminal
- github-responder can be used as a library in other Go programs
